[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/btrdb.v5?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/gopkg.in/btrdb.v5)

These are the go BTrDB bindings. This branch is compatible with version 5, a very recent rewrite of BTrDB. Note that it is likely you should be using the version 4 bindings of BTrDB as v5 is not widely released.

You can read the API documentation and code examples by clicking the godoc button above. To import this package in your code, add

```
import "gopkg.in/BTrDB/btrdb.v5"
```
